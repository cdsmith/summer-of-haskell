title: CodeWorld Editing and Debugging Tools
---

CodeWorld is an educational web-based programming environment based on
Haskell.  There are significant opportunities to make the project
easier to use and more successful for students by rethinking editing
and debugging tools in a functional setting.  The possible feature set
is very large, and a significant part of this project would be choosing
a set of features to work on.  Someone could work on a single ambitious
feature, or a collection of smaller features with a cumulative impact.

Specific ideas include:

1. Extending the auto-complete interface, and adding contextual hints
   as the user types code, to offer relevant documentation as the user
   types code.
2. Offering better visual clues in the editor interface.  CodeWorld
   users are typically children, and struggle with nesting and syntax
   structure.  Ideas include color-coding function names with their
   corresponding arguments, or marking up major syntax to make the
   structure apparent.
3. Extending the debugging features.  CodeWorld now offers some unique
   debugging features that show users how shapes in their output link
   back to their code.  This could be extended to include Elm-style
   time-traveling debugging features, and other useful extensions.
